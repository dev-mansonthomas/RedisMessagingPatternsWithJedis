# AI Context Documentation

This directory contains consolidated documentation optimized for AI assistants (Augment Code, Claude, etc.) to quickly understand the project.

## 📁 Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | High-level project overview, architecture, key concepts |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md` | Technical details, Lua functions, Java services, API endpoints |

## 🎯 Usage

- **AI assistants**: Read both files to understand the project before making changes
- **Developers**: See `../README.md` for user-facing documentation

## 📝 Notes

- These files are kept in sync with the actual implementation
- Content is optimized for AI comprehension (concise, structured, with code references)
- Human-readable but not intended as primary developer documentation
