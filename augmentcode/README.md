If you're a developer examining this project, you should focus on:

1. **`../README.md`** - Main project documentation
2. **`../STARTUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - How to run the project
3. The actual source code in `src/` and `frontend/src/`

The files in this directory are supplementary and can be safely ignored for normal development work.
